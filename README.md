# Node.js Master Class Work
---------------------------

I'm working through this course from Skillshare. I've been using Node.js for years and years and years ... but not really. I've been using Node.js _modules_ and _libraries_ for years and years and years.

This is me attempting to dig into the guts of Node.js itself. It's an old class so we'll have to make adjustments along the way. `url.parse(...)` VS `new URL(pathname, baseUrl)`, eg. That's all part of the fun, though.

The tut covers three builds ...

* [A RESTful API for Uptime Monitoring](restful-api-uptime-monitor/README.md)
* ... tbd ...
* ... tbd ...
